This is an Pokemon App that fetches it's information trough 2 API-fetches from the site     <a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank" >PokéApi</a>. It works as an Pokedex, which means that the user can select from the Original 151 Pokémon trough a list. When a Pokémon is choosen more information about it is showed.</p>

<p> 
The Pokemon App is made by:
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
<li>JSON, API calls made by using fetch()</li>

</ul>

</p>

<h2>Process </h2>

I wanted to make a Pokedex for the original 151 Pokémon, so i found the PokeApi that suited my idea. It had all the information of Pokémons to fetch. I started out with the HTML for the website structure and CSS for the design. I made it simple so i hade time to make the functions in Javascript that fetched the API from Pokeapi trough their JSON-files.

I started out with first just trying to get the information looped out on the website by a for each loop to be sure that it was connected right. After it worked, i put it in a button which looped out the list when clicked. I added a Value ID code next to the Pokémon-names, so when clicked another API-fetch was called. The value ID code made it possible to loop out the information of the choosen Pokémon that gets displayed.

<h2> To Do: </h2>

<p> 
<ul>
<li>Add a Loading Screen</li>
<li>Put the JSON files on my own Website for faster Fetch.</li>
<li>Figure out how to Display Evolutions</li>
</ul>
